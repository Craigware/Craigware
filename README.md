# üëë About me
Hey there, I'm Craig. I started coding in middle school with a scripting language called Skript for Minecraft. At the time I didn't even know what programming was, I was just writing text that made Minecraft act how I wanted it to. I really enjoyed this experience and got into game development, and game development opened the doors to all other forms of software for me.
