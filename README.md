# 👑 About me
Hey there, my name is Craig Johnson, and I am in love with software development... Programming in general really. I started coding in middle school, creating Minecraft minigames with a language called SkriptLang. That led me to grow an interest in game design and front end development. These two hobbies really sparked my enthusiasm for coding. They combined both my creative hobby of art and logical hobby of coding, and so I fell in love.     
I've had my hands on several different languages. C# has to be the language I have the most experience with, Javascript is by far my most used front end language, and Python dominates my time utilized in the back-end. Generally picking up new languages and frameworks is pretty easy for me.     
I have two personal projects I am currently working on, my portfolio website and a game review social media that I have been calling complet. I am what some may call a gamer. I love the classics. Pokemon and Minecraft are by far my favorite casual games, while for competition my favorite game would have to be League of Legends. A little fun fact about me is I was ranked in the top 1% of players in North America at League of Legends in 2021.
