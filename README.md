# üëë About me
Hey there, my name is Craig Johnson, and I am in love with software development... Programming in general really. I started coding in middle school, creating Minecraft minigames with a language called SkriptLang. That led me to grow an interest in game design and front end development. These two hobbies really sparked my enthusiasm for coding. They combined both my creative hobby of art and logical hobby of coding, and so I fell in love.
